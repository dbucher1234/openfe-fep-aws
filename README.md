# üî¨ OpenFE FEP workflow on AWS

This repo shows a minimal **Free-Energy Perturbation (FEP)** campaign with
[OpenFE](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe) on AWS.  

Provided an educational example for 5 ligands ranked in the T4 Lysozyme L99A (pdb 4W52), which was completed within a few hours on a 8xGPU instance (`g5.48xlarge`).

This repo provides scripts, environment setup, and workflows to prep, execute, and analyze FEP runs.

## üìÅ What‚Äôs Inside

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [prep/](prep)         | Ligand & system prep scripts (e.g., parmetrize ligands with ML, clean pdb) |
| [run/](run)           | AWS batch scripts, job configs, launch helpers |
| [example/](example) | Toy dataset (small protein + ligands + dummy results) to test |

## üöÄ Quick Start

Clone the repo and create your environment:

```bash
# 0) clone 
git clone https://github.com/dbucher1234/openfe-fep-aws.git
cd openfe-fep-aws

# 1) prep ligands (optional: will use ML partial charges instead of AM1/BCC to save compute time)
conda env create -f espaloma_env.yml
conda activate esp
cd prep
python esp_neutral.py ligands.sdf 
cp charged_ligands.sdf ligands.sdf  #  overwrites the ligands.sdf file with the charges in

# 2) prep protein (fixpdb if needed)
conda env create -f openfe_env.yml
conda activate openfe
python clean_protein.py

# 3) login to AWS
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids *AWS-ID-HERE*
# login by ssh to the instance, and send by scp: the ligands.sdf, protein.pdb + /run

# 4) On AWS
# after installing OpenFE and its environement, one can run:
openfe plan-rbfe-network -M ligands.sdf -p cleaned_protein.pdb -o network_setup/transformations
# default options for the network and 5 ligands creates 8 transformations (4 in solvent + 4 in complex), which is trivial to parallelize on 8 GPUs.
