# ðŸ§ª Toy System: L99A Lysozyme + Alkylbenzenes

This folder contains a minimal working example of the full FEP workflow,
from ligand generation to analysis, using a known benchmark system:

- **Protein**: T4 Lysozyme L99A (cavity mutant)
- **Ligands**: Benzene â†’ Toluene â†’ Phenol â†’ Aniline â†’ Isopropylbenzene
- **Binding pocket**: Matches experimental binding data (see `../references/`)

In my FEP calculations, I get the following results for the relative free energy (no error bars due to the lack of repeats, and limited accuracy due to 2ns per leg):

ligand_i	ligand_j	DDG(i->j) (kcal/mol)	uncertainty (kcal/mol)
lig_A	lig_C	-0.1	0.0
lig_A	lig_D	0.1	0.0
lig_A	lig_E	-0.1	0.0
lig_B	lig_D	0.3	0.0

It means for instance that lig_A is getting more stable by 0.1 when transformed to lig_C. 
Knowing lig_A DG value is -5.16 kcal/mol, we get resulting absolute binding free energies: 

Ligand | Predicted Î”G (kcal mol-Â¹)
lig_A (Benzene) | âˆ’5.16  (given)
lig_B (Toluene) | âˆ’5.36
lig_C (Phenol) | âˆ’5.26
lig_D (Aniline) | âˆ’5.06
lig_E (Isopropylbenzene) | âˆ’5.26

Interpretation:
â€¢ Toluene (lig_B) is predicted to bind ~0.2 kcal mol-Â¹ more strongly than benzene.
â€¢ Phenol and isopropylbenzene tie at âˆ’5.26 kcal mol-Â¹.
â€¢ Aniline is the weakest of the set by this calculation.

In general, most of them falls within 1 kcal, thus are not that interesting. One would be looking for a much better compound and then try to confirm the predictions with more sampling time and repeats.
