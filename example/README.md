# üß™ Toy System: L99A Lysozyme + Alkylbenzenes

This folder contains a minimal working example of the full FEP workflow,
from ligand generation to analysis, using a known benchmark system:

- **Protein**: T4 Lysozyme L99A (cavity mutant)
- **Ligands**: Benzene ‚Üí Toluene ‚Üí Phenol ‚Üí Aniline ‚Üí Isopropylbenzene
- **Binding pocket**: Matches experimental binding data (see `../references/`)

In my FEP calculations, I get the following results for the relative free energy (no error bars due to the lack of repeats, and limited accuracy due to 2ns per leg). Knowing lig_A DG value is -5.16 kcal/mol, we can approximate absolute binding free energies:

The predicted affinity for the compounds is the following:

Interpretation:

Some consistency with experiments: Toluene (lig_B) is predicted to bind ~0.2 kcal mol‚Åª¬π more strongly than benzene (lig_A). Aniline (lig_D) is the weakest of the set by this calculation.

But all compounds fail to impress (in agreement with experiments). In a real drug discovery program, one would be looking for a compound predicted better by more than 1 kcal, and then confirm it with more sampling and more repeats.
